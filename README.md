# simple-scheduler

A simple scheduler widget for Mendix. This scheduler is based on [react-big-scheduler](https://github.com/StephenChou1017/react-big-scheduler).

## Downloading it from the marketplace

This widget can simply be download from the Mendix Marketplace.

## Description

With this widget you can define resources and events for the resources. You can just drag and drop the events between resources or dates. You can even create events by choosing the dates.

## How to use

Note that the widget itself can be implemented however you see fit. But to understand how the widget works this readme can be used as a example. This widget assumes a certain structure to your data. Events belong to single resources, which in turn are grouped uniquely into groups. If your data structure differs significantly from this. <br/>
